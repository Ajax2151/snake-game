# snake-game

This is a Python Turtle clone of the Snake Game. You score points by "feeding" the snake with the randomly generated food items that pop up, but you need to be careful not to collide with the walls of the screen or your own ever-expanding tail.

11/28/23: Added high score tracking and removed "game over" displays and methods.
